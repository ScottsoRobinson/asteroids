This version of asteroids was written in javascript. It has similar functionality to the traditional game, the asteroids break up into smaller pieces when shot and will eventually be destroyed in their smallest size. It is essentially an exercise in combining some different aspects of physics (constant speed bullets, max speed for the ship and asteroids no matter the direction of the vectors -- the speeds are normalized, etc.) into a javascript browser game.
